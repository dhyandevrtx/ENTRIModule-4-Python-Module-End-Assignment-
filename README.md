Project: ABC Company Employee Analysis
Overview

This project aims to analyze a dataset provided by ABC Company, containing information about their employees. The analysis focuses on understanding the distribution of employees across teams, identifying key positions, analyzing age demographics, and exploring salary trends.

Data Preprocessing

Before conducting the analysis, the dataset was preprocessed to ensure data consistency and accuracy. Specifically, the "height" column, which contained inconsistent data, was replaced with random values between 150 and 180 cm.

Data Analysis

The following analysis tasks were performed:

Team Distribution:

Determined the number of employees in each team.
Calculated the percentage of employees in each team relative to the total workforce.
Employee Positions:

Identified the different positions within the company.
Grouped employees based on their respective positions.
Age Group:

Analyzed the age distribution of employees.
Identified the predominant age group within the company.
Salary Expenditure:

Calculated the total salary expenditure for each team and position.
Identified the team and position with the highest salary expenditure.
Age-Salary Correlation:

Investigated the relationship between age and salary.
Visualized the correlation using appropriate plots.
Data Visualization

To effectively communicate the findings, various visualizations were created, including:

Bar charts to illustrate team distribution and position counts.
Histograms to visualize age distribution.
Scatter plots to explore the correlation between age and salary.
Key Insights

By analyzing the provided dataset, valuable insights have been gained into ABC Company's workforce. These insights can inform strategic decision-making, such as workforce planning, talent acquisition, and compensation strategies.

Future Work

Potential areas for further analysis include:

Deeper dive into the relationship between employee performance and salary.
Exploring the impact of different factors (e.g., experience, education) on salary.
Analyzing employee turnover rates and identifying potential causes.
